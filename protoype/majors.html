General information will include a discussion board for students to talk about their classes and the major as a whole.
<br>
Pinned and upvoted notes can be left to inform all students in the major about upcoming events, internships, professor feedback.
<br>
Individual classes can contain information about pre-requisite courses, what technical knowledge you should have before taking the course,
<br>what professors have taught in the past and teach currently. A feature we are interested in is collecting the RateMyProfessors ratings 
<br> on a class by class basis, rather than for professors in total. <br>
Individual classes can also contain information for textbooks, required tools for the course, and student enjoyment of the class, <br> maybe akin
to how students leave professor feedback at the end of each term.
